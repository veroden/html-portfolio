<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m Veronica, a web developer in training with a passion for building modern,
  accessible, and efficient web applications. I enjoy the challenge of solving
  problems through code and bringing ideas to life on the web
</p>

<p>
  Right now, I’m gaining hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
  React, and I’m excited to continue growing my skills and exploring new
  technologies. My goal is to combine creativity and problem-solving to craft
  digital solutions that make an impact.
</p>

<p>
  When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me reading, knitting, crocheting, or
  spending time with my kiddo. I’m always curious, always learning, and always
  looking for ways to push myself as a developer.
